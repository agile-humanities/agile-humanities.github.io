            <h4>More About Our Agency.</h4>
            <p>Agile works with clients from disciplines across the arts, humanities, and social sciences and partners with galleries, libraries, archives, and museums.</p>  
            <p>We specialize in open-source development, design themes and platforms, model and migrate data, create custom apps, modules, tools, extensions, and plugins, and recirculate code through our public GitHub repository.</p>
            <p>We form geographically distributed "agile networks" among clients and rapidly assembled teams of programmers, designers, information and systems architects, and project managers. Our partner contractors range in scale from solo freelancers to boutique firms.<p/> 
            <p>Our networks are global, so we're accustomed to working across continents, oceans, and time zones. We cultivate a culture of remote collaboration.</p>
            <p>Agile occupies a niche of limited-budget, rapid-delivery software customization, data management, and design services. Our clients require solutions that go beyond the expertise of student programmers, that exceed capacities of services available at home institutions, or that fall below the profit margins of larger software and design shops.</p> 
			<p>Sometimes we collaborate with student programmers and assistants employed by a project or institution, so they end up getting training on the job. Sometimes we collaborate with other experts at an institution, so we distribute responsibilities. These configurations change from job to job, institution to institution. No agile network is exactly alike; each one is a custom fit.</p>
