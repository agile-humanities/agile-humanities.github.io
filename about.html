            <h4>More About Our Agency.</h4>
            <p>We recognize that many digital humanists pride themselves on a DIY model that readily accommodates the realization of individual research initiatives (or a modified version of the same that includes hands-on training for student researchers) funded by granting agencies, others avail themselves of software development services provided at their home institutions, and still others follow the multi-institutional and cross-sector partnership model that funds large-scale academic and industry initiatives. Our clients require solutions that go beyond the expertise of student programmers typically drafted into service by grant-funded researchers, that exceed the capacities of services available at home institutions, or that fall below the profit-margin threshold of larger software-industry shops. Agile is thus positioned in a niche of limited-budget, rapid-delivery open-source software customization and design services for DH and GLAM clients. Instead of running a shop with salaried employees, the agency forms "agile networks" among clients and rapidly assembled teams of programmers, designers, documenters, and trainers who work under contract for Agile.</p> 

<p>Budgets depend on our clients’ access to resources and how much labour clients are contributing to the job. Sometimes we take on jobs in collaboration with student programmers and themers employed by a project or institution, so they end up getting training as they work with experienced folks at Agile who share their expertise. Sometimes we collaborate with other experienced staff at an institution, so we delegate tasks according to the competencies of those in-house folks who are made available for a job. These “agile” configurations change from job to job, institution to institution. </p>
