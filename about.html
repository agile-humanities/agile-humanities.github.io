            <h4>More About Our Agency.</h4>
            <p>Agile Humanities Agency works with clients from disciplines across the arts, humanities, and social sciences and partners with galleries, libraries, archives, archives, and museums.</p>  
            <p>We specialize in open-source development, design themes and platforms, model and migrate data, create custom apps, modules, tools, extensions, and plugins, and recirculate code through our public GitHub repository.</p>
            <p>We form geographically distributed "agile networks" among clients and rapidly assembled teams of programmers, designers, information and systems architects, and project managers. Our partner contractors range in scale from solo freelancers to boutique firms.<p/> 
            <p>Our networks are global, so we're accustomed to working across continents, oceans, and time zones. We cultivate a culture of remote collaboration.</p>
            <p>We recognize that many digital humanists pride themselves on a DIY model.  Our clients require solutions that go beyond the expertise of student programmers drafted into service by grant-funded researchers, that exceed the local capacities of services available at institutions, or that fall below the profit margins of larger software and design shops. Agile positions itself in a niche of limited-budget, rapid-delivery software customization, data management, and design services.</p> 
			<p>Budgets depend on our clientsâ€™ access to resources and how much labour clients can contribute. Sometimes we take on jobs in collaboration with student programmers and research assistants employed by a project or institution, so they end up getting training as they work with experienced folks at Agile. Sometimes we collaborate with other experts at an institution, so we delegate and distribute responsibilities among in-house and Agile personnel. These configurations change from job to job, institution to institution. No agile network is exactly alike; each one is a custom fit.</p>
