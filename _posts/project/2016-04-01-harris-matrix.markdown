HARRIS MATRIX VISUALIZATION

The Harris Matrix is a tool used to depict the temporal succession of archaeological contexts and thus the sequence of deposition on a 'dry land' archaeological site. The matrix reflects the relative position and stratigraphic contacts of observable stratigraphic units, or contexts. 

The Harris Matrix Composer (http://www.harrismatrixcomposer.com/) is currently the only actively maintained dedicated piece of software for developing Harris matrices. While matrices created with this software can be printed or saved as PDFs, there is currently no way to display them natively in a browser, as part of a website. The first part of this project aims to develop d3.js visualization code that can render in a browser a Harris matrix generated by Harris Matrix Composer, as it appears in that software. The second part of the project will connect the visualization to the Drupal content management system, by mapping stratigraphic units depicted in the visualization to taxonomy terms that are used to tag the archaeological findings stored as nodes in Drupal. Clicking on any stratigraphic unit in the visualization will take the user to the taxonomy term page corresponding to that unit.
