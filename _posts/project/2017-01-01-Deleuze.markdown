# The Deleuze Seminars

In partnership with the NEH-funded Gilles Deleuze Seminar Translations project, Agile is working with a distributed network of editors and translators. Based at Purdue University and funded by an [Enhancing Research in the Humanities and the Arts Grant][grant], The Deleuze Seminars is allied with the Universit√© Paris 8 site, [La voix de Gilles Deleuze en ligne][voix]. Agile is building a custom-designed Drupal 8 site to host original audio files, transcriptions, and translations and developing workflow tools for project members to manage versions, changes, annotations, work scheduling, and progress reporting. We will be replacing a web [prototype][prototype] developed for earlier stages of research on the Deleuze translations.

Our timeline for release is December 2017.
