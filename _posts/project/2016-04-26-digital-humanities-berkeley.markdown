# DIGITAL HUMANITIES AT BERKELEY

“Digital Humanities at Berkeley supports the thoughtful application of digital tools and methodologies to humanistic inquiry by offering project consulting, summer workshops, grants for collaborative research and new courses, and other activities at UC Berkeley.

Digital Humanities at Berkeley is a partnership between the Office of the Dean of Arts and Humanities and Research IT in the Office of the CIO. It is supported by a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, with additional support from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research.”
