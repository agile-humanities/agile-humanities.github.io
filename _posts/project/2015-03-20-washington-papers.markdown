THE PAPERS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON

The Partial Date Drupal 7 module provides a field with flexible date granularity (some nodes can have day/month/year, some can have month/year, some can have just year, all in the same field). Partial Date allows users to define and use approximate time periods (“spring,” “morning,” and so on). It also has a built-in “approximate” checkbox as part of the same date field.

While the Partial Date module with Feeds support will be used by The Papers of George Washington, it will be of general use to any scholarly project in which there is some irregularity in their temporal data.
