[Islandora][islandora] is an open-source software framework, maintained by a [non-profit foundation][if], designed to help institutions and organizations manage and discover their digital assets. Constructed around a core of [Drupal][drupal], [FedoraCommons][fedora], and [Solr][solr], Islandora also releases community-supported [modules and Solution Packs][modules] that extend its functionality. 

Solution Packs provide an extensible framework for the ingestion, organization, and display of digital assets stored in a FedoraCommons repository through a front-end Drupal web interface. As well, Solution Packs provide integration with additional viewers, editors, and applications. Islandora strikes a balance between extensibility and usability, by providing ready-made support for digital collections, while maintaining an architecture that lends itself to customization.

Islandora can be installed in a single instance, which provides one point of entry for content management, or deploy multisite instances, which allow multiple points of entry and management. All digital assets are located in a single FedoraCommons repository, but each multisite controls access to its data and administers security protocols for the contents deposited in the repository.
