###Branding DH
Beginning at Malaspina College (now Vancouver Island University) in 2001 and migrating to the University of Victoria in 2004, the Digital Humanities Summer Insitute (DHSI) has become a kind of UNESCO heritage site for DH pilgrims. As one of those perennial DH travellers returning year by year to the west coast, I've landed at the registration table on the edge of the parking lot at the Craigdarroch Residences and traded my name for a badge and institute swag. After a decade I've accumulated a sizable collection of mass-produced relics &ndash; a cupboard of thermal mugs and a drawer of flash drives. All bear the signature brands of DHSI &ndash; its unregistered trademarks, or to put it another way, its marks of *trade*.

The history of DHSI is coeval with the launch and marketing of the digital humanities as a transnational franchise (consider, for instance, the growth of the DH Training Network from this progenitor to DH@Oxford, DH@Leipzig, DHI Beirut, HILT @ UTAustin, Programming4Humanists @ Texas A&M, DH@Guelph, ILiaDS@Hamilton College, Digital Methods Training @ Western Sydney, and the travelling DHSI@Congress and DHSI@MLA roadshows &ndash; all modeled on DHSI). Both DHSI and the DH Training Network coincide with the twenty-first-century institutional formation of the neoliberal university. The DH brands that alumni carry around act as ubiquitous advertisements circulating after the event itself through a global dispersion of DH institutions, conferences, and workshops; their trail is the signature of neoliberal marketing, an unfettered access to DH markets. This unregulated discourse of trade and trading, masrkets and marketing, brands and branding circulates through the economies of DH.

###Decolonizing DH Pedagogy
Each year DHSI begins in an auditorium, where the participants gather and, in recent years, university administrators acknowledge that they are visitors to the traditional territory of the Ws'anec' (Saanich), Lkwungen (Songhees), and Wyomilth (Esquimalt) peoples. Even so, this acknowledgement has yet to make a lasting and demonstrable impact on the institute curriculum or the participation of First Nations students, researchers, and instructors. At DHSI 2017, Dorothy Kim and Angel David Nieves will be offering a short workshop on “Race, Social Justice, and DH: Applied Theories and Methods,” which will "pay special attention to queer theory, critical ethnic studies, postcolonial theory, WOC/Black feminism, Indigenous studies, and disability studies” in an intersectional approach to "challenge the all-white discourse, often dominated by scholars in the disciplines of English and history, that is too often found in digital humanities.” Yet none of the 48 5-day courses offered over a period of two weeks addresses indigeneity; this lacuna is especially telling after a year in which the DH community has been embroiled in social-media fueled controversies about diversity and DHSI (along with other ADHO member organizations) has issued its own intersectional “Statement on Ethics and Inclusion."

I'd like to address the productivity of such intersectional modes of disciplinary and institutional practice, but place particular emphasis on the need for public reconciliation of the DHSI curriculum with the dispossession of indigenous peoples and their traditional lands on which DHSI takes place each June. This means paying closer attention to local traditions and economies of land use in the area, both indigenous and colonial. It means placing under scrutinty the economic forces that shape the markey of DH pedagogy, which polemicists in the *LA Review of Books* rather reductively aligned with the neoliberal university, where they claim "the acqusition of markertable skills, and the ability to justify those skills [is] integral to the market-oriented evolution of knowledge and education." And, consequently, it means taking stock of alternative digital pedagogy markets, where teachings about the traditional knowledges of local indigenous peoples are allied with learning about decolonizing mapping technologies and language revitalization apps and where, at UVic, the Ws'anec', Lekwungen, and Wyomilth (as well as visitors to their territories) can educate themselves about how these skills, tools, and apps are being used to advodate for land claims and resource rights in the courts and to support activist movements to enact social, legal, and economic justice and self-government.
