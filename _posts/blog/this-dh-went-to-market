###Branding DH
Beginning at Malaspina College (now Vancouver Island University) in 2001 and migrating to the University of Victoria in 2004, the Digital Humanities Summer Insitute (DHSI) has become a kind of UNESCO heritage site for DH pilgrims. As one of those perennial DH travellers returning year by year to the west coast, I've landed at the registration table on the edge of the parking lot at the Craigdarroch Residences and traded my name for a badge and institute swag. After a decade I've accumulated a sizable collection of mass-produced relics &ndash; a cupboard of thermal mugs and a drawer of flash drives. All bear the signature brands of DHSI &ndash; its unregistered trademarks, or to put it another way, its marks of *trade*.

The history of DHSI is coeval with the launch and marketing of the digital humanities as a transnational franchise (consider, for instance, the growth of the DH Training Network from this progenitor to DH@Oxford, DH@Leipzig, DHI Beirut, HILT @ UTAustin, Programming4Humanists @ Texas A&M, DH@Guelph, ILiaDS@Hamilton College, Digital Methods Training @ Western Sydney, and the travelling DHSI@Congress and DHSI@MLA roadshows &ndash; all modeled on DHSI). Both DHSI and the DH Training Network coincide with the twenty-first-century institutional formation of the neoliberal university. The DH brands that alumni carry around act as ubiquitous advertisements circulating after the event itself through a global dispersion of DH institutions, conferences, and workshops; their trail is the signature of neoliberal marketing, an unfettered access to DH markets. This unregulated discourse of trade and trading, masrkets and marketing, brands and branding circulates through the economies of DH.

###Decolonizing DH Pedagogy
Each year DHSI begins in an auditorium, where the participants gather and, in recent years, university administrators acknowledge that they are visitors to the traditional territory of the Ws'anec' (Saanich), Lkwungen (Songhees), and Wyomilth (Esquimalt) peoples. Even so, this acknowledgement has yet to make a lasting and demonstrable impact on the institute curriculum or the participation of First Nations students, researchers, and instructors. At DHSI 2017, Dorothy Kim and Angel David Nieves will be offering a short workshop on “Race, Social Justice, and DH: Applied Theories and Methods,” which will "pay special attention to queer theory, critical ethnic studies, postcolonial theory, WOC/Black feminism, Indigenous studies, and disability studies” in an intersectional approach to "challenge the all-white discourse, often dominated by scholars in the disciplines of English and history, that is too often found in digital humanities.” Yet none of the 48 5-day courses offered over a period of two weeks addresses indigeneity; this lacuna is especially telling after a year in which the DH community has been embroiled in social-media fueled controversies about diversity and DHSI (along with other ADHO member organizations) has issued its own intersectional “Statement on Ethics and Inclusion."
